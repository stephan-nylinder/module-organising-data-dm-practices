> ### About this episode

> ## Exercise
> Starting with the zip-file containing the inherited file system shown above, can you adapt the information from the previous episodes to bring order to the system, provide better file names, a clear folder structure, and add one or more README files?
>
>> ### Solution
>> There are many potential ways to improve the file system. The [downloadable](../data/Famous_project_in_order.zip) solution should not be seen as the only alternative, but as one of many possible solutions.
