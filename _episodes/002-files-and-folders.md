> ## About this episode 
> This episode addresses some of the reasons to why file organisation is important for data management and a selection of good practices for organising research folders and files. The aim is to get you started and thinking about what will work for you and your project or team. Depending on your research area and the type of research you're involved in; you may find a more optimal way to organize your work.

## Good practices for organising files and folders
Depending on your background and experiences you could be thinking of different reasons to why it would be beneficial or useful to systematically organise your research and data files. The following is a selection of common reasons:

* Easier to locate a file
* Find similar files together
* Moving files becomes much easier
* Easy to identify which files you want to back up
* Keep organised in the long-run
* Increases productivity
* Helps you to keep and maintain a record of the project
* Projects can easily be understood by others (including your future self)

It’s natural for some of your files to become unorganised from time to time—perhaps your downloads or desktop folder—and in those cases there may be multiple copies and versions of files cluttering your view and making it challenging to find what you're looking for. You can avoid this clutter by planning for organising your files ahead of time, and any system is better than none.

![Unorganised files on desktop][files_messy_tidy]

In this context we will be looking into practices for classifying and structuring files and folders to make them more useful. Your guiding principle should be that someone unfamiliar with your project should be able to look at your files and understand, in detail, what you did and why. This someone could be a researcher who wants to reproduce the results in your article, a new collaborator who needs to understand the details of your experiments, or—more commonly—that someone could be your future self not remembering what you were up to when you created a particular set of files.  Poor organisation practices can lead to significantly slower research progress and you may end up having to spend significant time re-organising yourself among files and contents you once knew.
<!-- it is not yourself that you will re-organise... -->
## File and folder naming 

Names for files and folders should be consistent and meaningful to yourself and collaborators, allow for easy tracking/searching, and be somewhat descriptive of content.

An example:

`LD_phyA_off_t04_2020-08-12_norm.xlsx`

Based on the name, the file could contain information about:

* `LD` - Long day sampling, of the
* `phyA` - Phytochrome A genotype, in a 
* `off` - Media without sucrose, at
* `t04` - Time point 4,
* `2020-08-12` - Sampled on Aug 12th, 2020, with
* `norm` - Normalised data

However, this is not obvious from the text and letters alone. Some sort of explanation is usually required, which could be added to a README-file stored in proximity to the data files.

> ### Exercise - Naming and Sorting
> The following example contain files from an imaginary project, similar to the above example. To facilitate the exercise file name convention state that: <!-- I don't understand the preceeding sentence, is it 'To facilitate the exercise, the file name convention states that:'? -->
> - *phyA/phyB* are genotypes
> - *sXX* is the sample number
> - *LD/SD* are light conditions (Long Day, Short Day)
> - *on/off* are different growth media (on sucrose, off sucrose)
> - *date format* is the sample date
> - *tXX* is the sample timepoint 
> - *raw*, *norm* indicates raw or normalised data

> Try to answer the following questions:
> - Should dates be put first, and if not, why?
> - What is the difference between using leading 0 (zero) or not?
> - Is there a difference between using upper and lower case letters?
> - What is the difference between using two letters for *on* compared to three letters *ons*?

>> ### Solutions
>>> * Using dates as leading information in file names makes finding data quickly harder as the more interesting information may be samples or timepoints. 
>>> * Wihtout leading zeros, sorting will make 10 and 11 appear before 2.
>>> * Upper and lower cases may sort differently 
>>> * Comparing files is easier if the file name lenghts are constant.  
>>> * Mixed naming conventions can make it very difficult to locate particular files, and/or sort a large number of files.

### Choose a file naming strategy
Two starting points for your file naming strategy are:

- #### A file name is a principal identifier of a file
    Good file names contain useful clues to the content, status and version of a file, uniquely identify a file and help in classifying and sorting files. File names that reflect the file content also facilitate searching and discovering files. In collaborative research, it is essential to keep track of changes and edits to files via the file name.
- #### File naming strategy should be consistent in time and among different people
    In both quantitative and qualitative research, file naming should be systematic and consistent across all files in the study. A group of cooperating researchers should follow the same file naming strategy and file names should be independent of the location of the file on a computer.


### Naming files and folders

A File Naming Convention is a framework, or protocol if you like, for naming your files in a way that describes what the files contain and, importantly, how they relate to other files.

## Information vs. Name length
Long file and folder names are always good because they contain more information, right? Wrong! Long names do hold more information, but also make them cumbersome. Certain software have hard coded limitations on path lengths, e.g. since Windows95 the Windows OS usually have problems with combined path lenghts exceeding 260 characters. And even in case your OS supports longer paths, some software may not. Truncated folder or file names may seriously impact findability and sortability, or even cause errors. As a problem, this also increases with folder naming and file system depth. 

> ### Discussion

>> ### Potential benefits of a File Naming Convention
>> - Easier to process - Team members will not have to over think the file naming process
>> - Easier to facilitate access, retrieval and storage of files
>> - Easier to browse through files, saving time and effort
>> - Harder to lose!
>> - Having logical and known naming conventions in place can also help you with version control.
>> - Check for obsolete or duplicate records

### Three principles for (file) names:

1. Machine readable – Avoid spaces, deliberate punctuation, no accented characters, consistent letter casing
1. Human readable - A name describes the content of the file
1. Plays well with default ordering – put something numeric first, use the ISO 8601 standard for dates, left pad other numbers with zeros

### Do's:

* For dates use the YYYY-MM-DD standard and place at the end of the file UNLESS you need to organize your files chronologically

* Include version number (if applicable), use leading zeroes (i.e.: v005 instead of v5).
make sure the 3-letter file format extension is present at the end of the name (e.g. .doc, .xls, .mov, .tif)

* Add a README (or PROJECT_STRUCTURE) file in your top directory which details your naming convention, directory structure and abbreviations


### Avoid (Don'ts):

* Using spaces (use _ or - instead)

* Dots, commas and special characters (e.g. ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ` ; < > ? , [ ] { } ‘ “)

* Using language specific characters (e.g óężé), unfortunately they still cause problems with most software or between operating systems (OS)

* Long names

* Repetition, e.g if directory name is Electron_Microscopy_Images, and file ELN_MI_IMG_20200101.img then ELN_MI_IMG is redundant

* Deep paths with long names (i.e. deeply nested folders with long names), as archiving or moving between OS may fail

## How to organise files and folders
Spend some time planning how you are going to organise your data at the beginning of a project. Consider how you and others will look for and access the files throughout the project’s life cycle and ensure that all people involved can commit to using the folder hierarchy, file naming conventions, and a strategy for onboarding new contributors. You can start small and expand as you develop your practices.

### Use folders to divide files into categories
Put each project in its own folder named after that project. Ideally you want to keep the folder’s name under 32 characters long while at the same time including a combination of the project title, a unique identifier and the date. 

Consider the best hierarchy for the files in the project and decide whether a deep or shallow hierarchy is preferable. If you have several independent data collections, it is advisable to create a separate data folder for each collection. But you can use any meaningful characteristic or file attribute as a basis for organising your files, which of them will be most helpful varies widely across domains and specific projects. 


### Examples
<!-- i'm totally lost with these examples, what has this to do with how to organise files and folders? is the 'error' that the heading should be ## Examples rather than ### Examples, i.e. this section gives examples of everything / all sections above? -->
![][awesome_names]
<!-- why have this picture, without explanation, when you have almost the same under next heading? -->
---

#### Search and filtering friendly
<!-- the heading is the same size as the 'subheadings' below -->
**Except of complete file listing**:

![][plasmid_names]


**Same using Mac OS Finder search facilities**:

![][plasmid_mac_os_search]

**Same using regex in `R`**:

![][plasmid_regex]

---

#### Encode/extract metadata from filenames

Deliberate use of "-" and "_" allows recovery of meta-data from the filenames:

- "_" underscore used to delimit units of meta-data I want later.
- "-" hyphen used to delimit words so my eyes don't bleed.

![][plasmid_delimiters]


![][plasmid_delimiters_code]

This happens to be `R` but also possible in the `shell`, `Python`, etc.

#### Descriptive filenames

**Which set of file(name)s do you want at 3 a.m. before a deadline**?

![][human_readable_not_options]

---

### Plays well with default ordering

**Chronological order**:

![][chronological_order]

**Logical order**: Put something numeric first

![][logical_order]

**Dates**: Use the ISO 8601 standard for dates: YYYY-MM-DD
![][chronological_order]

**Left pad other numbers with zeros**

![][logical_order]

If you don’t left pad, you may get this:

```
 1_data-cleaning.R
 10_final-figs-for-publication.R
 11_final-fig-for-poster.R
 2_fit-model.R
 3_sort-values.R
 4_plot-graph.R
 5_histogram.R
 6_subdata-extraction.R
 7_calculate-median.R
 8_scatterplots.R
 9_experimental.R
```
---

### Folder organisation
Consider the following four different folder structures.

![file_organisation][file_organisation]

The first two (**A** and **B**) are recommended for computing.
The other two (**C** and **D**) are recommended for wet lab or biological projects.

> ### Exercise
> * Which one is the most similar one to your own project structure?
> * When/why would you use **A** compared to **B**?
> * When/why would you use **C** compared to **D**? 
>
>> ### Solution
>> - **A** could be preferred when you analyse different data under one unifying research question, while **B** could be preferred when you need/want to break down the data and analysis into separate variables.
>> - **C** is preferred when you organise data (in this case digital images from scans) by research object (e.g. pigs aka "patients"), while **D** is preferred when the focus of interest is an outcome of a treatment rather than the individuals themselves.
